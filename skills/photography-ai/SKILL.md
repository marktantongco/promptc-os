## 🎯 Philosophy of Professional Visual Engineering

The shift from "AI Artist" to "Professional Visual Engineer" represents a fundamental reorientation: the practitioner treats AI generation not as magic, but as a precision instrument that responds to physics, psychology, and deliberate architectural choices.

**Core Principles:**
- **Photorealistic Logic First**: Every generation operates within the laws of optics, anatomy, and spatial psychology. The AI models physics; you must understand the physics the AI is modeling.
- **Quiet Luxury of Execution**: Professional work reveals itself through restraint—precise control rather than maximum effect. The mark of expertise is knowing what *not* to prompt.
- **Intentional Architecture**: Structure prompts as you'd architect a building—load-bearing concepts first, decorative elements last. Token order isn't cosmetic; it's structural.
- **Verification as Discipline**: Generation is the beginning, not the end. Systematic quality gates, iteration loops, and mastery checklists separate professionals from enthusiasts.

This framework treats AI image generation as a professional engineering discipline: systematic, physics-informed, quality-gated, and continuously improvable.

## 📚 Core Skill Categories

### 1. Technical Prompt Engineering

*Constructing prompts as structured blueprints, not keyword lists. The input layer for all AI generation.*

| Sub-Skill | Explanation | Tools & Techniques | Example |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Scaffold Method** | Structured prompt order: `[Subject] + [Action] + [Lighting] + [Lens/Specs] + [Style] + [Quality]` | Prompt templates, style guides, token-aware editors | `A woman walking in rain + cinematic lighting + 85mm f/1.8 + photorealistic + 4K` |
| **Information Priority (Front-Loading)** | Place critical elements first; AI weights early tokens more heavily | Token analysis, prompt testing | `Oil painting of a castle...` (style first) vs. `A castle, oil painting...` |
| **Photographic Vocabulary** | Use precise technical terms over vague buzzwords | Lens/aperture glossaries, photography references | `85mm lens, f/2.8, shallow depth of field` instead of `hyperrealistic` |
| **Active Voice Editing** | Use clear action verbs for iterative edits and refinements | Inpainting prompts, edit command syntax | `remove the background`, `add a red hat`, `turn the car into a truck` |
| **Agent Prompting Patterns** | Design prompts for multi-step agent workflows using structured reasoning | Zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role prompting | `You are a cinematographer. First analyze the scene mood, then specify lighting.` |
| **Long-Horizon Video Scripts** | Maintain narrative coherence across extended video generation sequences | Dialogue-to-script translation, scene continuity prompts, beat sheets | `Scene 1: Close-up on protagonist, golden hour. Transition: Cross-dissolve to wide establishing shot.` |
| **Camera Movement Language** | Specify complex cinematography techniques in text prompts | Camera direction lexicon, film terminology guides | `pull from close-up to wide shot`, `circular tracking shot`, `dolly zoom` |
| **Advanced Prompt Syntax** | Master weighted syntax, conditional prompts, and parameter chaining for precise control | Weight syntax `::`, conditional branches, parameter interpolation, prompt variables | `(masterpiece:1.5), (best quality:1.3), [cinematic lighting] :: 0.8`, `--ar {16:9|9:16} --stylize {250|500}` |
| **Semantic Layering** | Stack semantic concepts in deliberate order to control interpretation hierarchy | Concept ordering, modifier placement, implicit vs explicit directives | `A [serious executive] [in shadows] [dramatic side lighting]` creates different emphasis than `[dramatic side lighting] [serious executive] [in shadows]` |
| **Style Injection Techniques** | Embed artistic references without overriding subject integrity | Style-strength anchors, reference blending, preservation weights | `::0.3` after style reference to preserve subject while adding aesthetic influence |
